# blutwurst - A test data generator.

"You don't want to know how the sausage is made."

Blutwurst is a utility for building test data sets based on some sort of
schema. These can then be exported to files for use in filling up a new
database or adding to unit tests.

## Installation

No installation archives exist (yet). We will add them once we reach a certain
level of completion on this project. In the meantime, clone this repository and run:

    lein uberjar

## Usage

To generate data, execute the JAR adding any other JDBC drivers to the classpath. An example is below that includes the sqlite jar:

    $  java  -Xverify:none -cp '.;lib/*;target/uberjar/blutwurst-0.2.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar' blutwurst.core [args]

This is, admittedly, not a great user experience. We will be developing wrapper scripts to make this nicer.    

## Options

In order to get a full list of the arguments supported by this application, run the following command:

    $ java -jar blutwurst.jar -h

## Examples

Imagine you have a [Derby](https://db.apache.org/derby/) database on your local machine. Running a command like so:

    java -cp '.;lib/*;blutwurst-0.3.0-standalone.jar' blutwurst.core --connection-string 'jdbc:derby:test.db' --format csv --directory mydata 

Will cause Blutwurst to start up, connect to Derby, scan the tables, generate data and export it as a CSV file per 
table in the `mydata` directory. This assumes that you have permissions to `test.db` and that the JAR files for the Derby client
are in the `lib` folder.

There are a number of other options. Running

    java -cp '.;lib/*;blutwurst-0.3.0-standalone.jar' blutwurst.core --help

Will print out a list of options. Please see the [manual](doc/intro.md) for a more comprehensive overview.

## Data Sources

The data used the random selection generators (like the person names or state names) was sourced
from the following locations:

* https://statetable.com/ (states, provinces and territories of the United States and Canada).
* https://www.census.gov/topics/population/genealogy/data/2010_surnames.html (Surnames in the 2010 United States Census).
* https://www.census.gov/topics/population/genealogy/data/1990_census/1990_census_namefiles.html (Personal names in the 1990 United States Census).
* https://sourceforge.net/p/squirrel-sql/git/ci/master/tree/sql12/core/src/net/sourceforge/squirrel_sql/client/resources/defaults/default_drivers.xml (classnames for various JDBC drivers).
